        <h2>contenteditable=minimal</h2>
        <p>This section updates Section 7.6.1 of HTML5.</p>
        <p>The contenteditable attribute is an enumerated attribute whose keywords are the empty string, true, false, and minimal. The empty string and the true keyword map to the true state. The false keyword maps to the false state. The minimal keyword maps to the minimal state. In addition, there is a fourth state, the inherit state, which is the missing value default (and the invalid value default).
        </p>
        <p>The true state indicates that the element is fully editable.
        </p>
        <p>The false state indicates that the element is not editable.
        </p>
        <p>The minimal state indicates that the element allows full use of the caret and selection. However, the browser MUST NOT insert any content into the element as a result of user action, including typing, formatting, and clipboard operations. Any script that would insert content if the contenteditable state were true, such as execCommand, MUST do so.
        </p>
        <p>The inherit state indicates that the element behaves as if it has the same state as its parent. 
        </p>
        <p>The contentEditable IDL attribute, on getting, 
        must return the string "true" if the content attribute is set to the true state, 
        "false" if the content attribute is set to the false state, 
        "minimal" if the the content attribute is set to the minimal state, 
        and "inherit" otherwise. 
        On setting, if the new value is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "inherit" then the content attribute must be removed, 
        if the new value is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "true" then the content attribute must be set to the string "true", 
        if the new value is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "false" then the content attribute must be set to the string "false", 
        if the new value is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "minimal" then the content attribute must be set to the string "minimal", 
        and otherwise the attribute setter must throw a SyntaxError exception.
        </p>
        <p>The isContentEditable IDL attribute, on getting, must return true if the element is either an editing host or fully editable, and false otherwise.
