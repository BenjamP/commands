        This document is a non-normative reference, which provides an overview of CommandEvents and contenteditable=minimal. 
        It summarizes the normative information in the respective specifications in easy-to-digest prose with illustrations.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        ContentEditable is used extensively on the web to enable users to directly edit HTML content. 
        However, it is very complex and its behavior is often largely overwritten by sites or javascript frameworks. 
        Completely overwriting it is very difficult because it requires overwriting all keyboard shortcuts that perform commands like bold and undo, 
        as well as the context menu. Further, this must be done in all supported languages. 
		A <a href="https://medium.com/medium-eng/122d8a40e480">post on Medium</a> tells one perspective of why it should be changed.
        To simplify this, a new level of abstraction is described in the CommandEvent specification, 
        which allows overwriting the behavior of individual user intentions.
        </p>
        <p>To further simplify the work for sites and frameworks that wish to provide functionality for the majority of commands directly, 
        the Minimal ContentEditable specification disables all commands by default, including text input. 
        This allows sites to easily provide their own implementations of commands as well as opt in to commands that they prefer the browser to handle,
		without having to worry about what they might have missed.

      <h2>Framing the Problem</h2>
        <section>
        <h3>Ways a User Indicates Their Intentions</h3>
        <p>
        There are several different ways users can indicate that they are trying to perform a given action. 
        For instance, a user may press control-z (or command-z on Mac) on an English keyboard to indicate that they would like to undo the latest action in the current context. 
        They may also use an undo item in a context menu for this. 
        In other languages, the keyboard shortcut may vary. 
        There may also be gestures for these intentions on various platforms, such as 'shake' on iOS. 
        </p><p>
		Shown below are some input methods and theoretical ways they could be used to select a word:

        <h3>Default Handling of User Intentions</h3>
        <p>
        By default, browsers handle a large number of user intentions, like typing and formatting text in editable regions, clipboard operations, and selection.
        Browsers have the built-in capability to understand a user's intention based on their localized input. 
		Browsers then use this understanding to perform the associated action, like actually selecting the word in the example above.
        </p>
        </section><section>
        <h3>Overriding Default Handling in Script</h3>
        Today, it is very difficult for a website to detect a user's intention directly. 
        Instead, they must infer it based on keyboard, pointer, input, mutation, or other events. 
		Keyboard events must be understood in a localized context. 
        And in some cases, such as actions on the browser's context menu, the user's intention can't be inferred at all because script is not made aware of the action.  
        </p>

      <h2>User Intention Events</h2>
        <section>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>In order to solve this problem, JavaScript needs a new level of abstraction for user intentions. 
		User Intention Events are that abstraction. 
		Building on the concepts that already exist in Clipboard Events and those that are being specified by <a href="http://w3c.github.io/selection-api/">Selection API</a>,
		we complete the picture with CommandEvent.
		The picture now looks like this:
		</p><p>

        </p>
        </section><section>
        <h3>Clipboard Events</h3>
        In order to assist in determining what a user intends, browsers already fire some events for user intentions, like Clipboard Events. 
        </section><section>
        <h3>Selection Events</h3>
		BeforeSelectionChange events will also help determine a user's intention. They are being considered for the Selection API spec.
        </section><section>
        <h3>CommandEvents</h3>
        Just like for Clipboard and Selection, a user's intention to execute commands (like those found on a toolbar) should be easily understandable by script.
		This allows sites to overwrite behavior as they see fit.
		For instance, if a site wants to manage the way bolding text works, they can list for a CommandEvent of type="bold",
		execute their own custom bold functionality, and preventDefault().
		They no longer need to listen for control+b on English keyboards or something else in other locales.
		Any platform-specific bold toolbars or gestures just work with their custom implementation as well.
        </section>
    </section><section>
      <h2>Minimal default handling with contenteditable=minimal</h2>
        <p>
        It is a pattern in web editors that are built on top of contenteditable to disable some commanding functionality. 
		The reason for this is that consistency for WYSIWYG editors is very hard, and requirements vary greatly from one editor to the next.
		Disabling all functionality is very difficult however.
		</p><p>
		In order to make it easier, contentEditable="minimal" on an element will fire all Intention Events (Selection, Clipboard, and Command),
		but only Selection events will have a default action.
		As is always the case with Intention Events, the default action for Selection events can be cancelled with preventDefault().
		The browser's typical handling of Clipboard and Command events can also be enabled per command by calling document.execCommand(evt.commandName).
